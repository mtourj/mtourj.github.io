        I am a full stack developer, I've worked on web and mobile apps as well
        as some games using the Unity engine as a hobby (I'm adding one to this
        portfolio soon!). You've come here to see what I've built; scroll down
        to see a showcase of some of my most recent projects. There'll be more
        coming, too!
